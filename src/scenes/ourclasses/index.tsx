              One day my dad drove up with a friend to see two nine-year-old
              boys in the driveway with a production line operating at full
              speed. There was fine white powder everywhere. On a long table
              were small milk cartons from school, and our familyâ€™s hibachi
              grill was glowing with red-hot coals at maximum heat.
